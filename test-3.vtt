What <c.reb>exactly</c> is <b>artificial</b> intelligence? 1

What <c.black>exactly</c> is <b>artificial</b> intelligence? 3

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.500
We talk about artificial intelligence

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.500
when computer systems perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.000
This includes, for example, recognizing images, making decisions, or participating in dialogue.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In order to do this, AI systems must be equipped with knowledge and experience.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This can be achieved in two ways.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You can program each individual instruction so that the device solves the task step by step.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Compare this with a cooking recipe or assembly instructions.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Alternatively, you can use software that learns from the data itself.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This allows them to discover relevant information, draw conclusions or make predictions.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is called machine learning.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We have all probably dealt with artificial intelligence at some point in our lives.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When watching movies, listening to music or shopping online.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
AI gives us recommendations about what we might want.

17
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Artificial intelligence is able to convert spoken language into text and translate it into other languages.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Artificial intelligence is a key component of robotics.

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Robots make our daily lives easier or take on difficult activities.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Self-driving cars learn about their environment through artificial intelligence and can respond to it.

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important in medicine.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Supports doctors when diagnosing diseases.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
More and more patients are also using AI-based applications for initial diagnosis.

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In the education sector, AI helps personalize learning activities, for example, on digital learning platforms.

25
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
AI is becoming increasingly important.

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Once we understand how AI works, we can better see where it can support everyday activities at home and at work.

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Where we want to make our own decisions

28
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
AI will not replace humans, but it is getting better and better at supporting us.

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
For this, we need a self-efficacy society.
